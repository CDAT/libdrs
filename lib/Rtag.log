        Version: V2_12, Date: Wed May 29 11:32:46 PDT 1996, Module: drslib, User: drach
-------------------
- Fixed bug in SGI version which caused precompiler on the Indy to
  select the wrong open statement (aslun.F)

  the include file to be added to the library, which causes a link error

    limits, for second instance stuff.
(3) Added error message in getslab when memory alloc fails.
(4) Fixed prdict error in logical unit for inqlun.
-------------------
        Version: V2_6, Date: Thu Mar 11 17:24:26 PST 1993, Module: drslib, User: drach

-------------------
(1) Fixed bug which caused copybuf in getslab to overwrite array bounds
    when reading Cray R*8 data on the Sun;
(2) Added routine getpelem to return user representation, rather than
    file representation, as in getelemd;
(3) Modified inqdict to support getpelem.
-------------------
        Version: V2_4, Date: Wed Dec 16 15:33:50 PST 1992, Module: drslib, User: drach
-------------------
1) Modified getdat to allow dimension ranges to be specified with
either setdim or setvdim.
2) Fixed a bug in putdat1, to allow second instance stuff to work
even with minor format translation errors on dimension values.
3) Fixed bugs in getdat and putdat, to return error values on
read or write errors.
-----------
Version: V2_3(C_4), Date: Wed Oct 14 16:22:00 PDT 1992
-----------
	Provided full support for renaming strings via putdic:
	1) Rewrote putdic to allow renaming all strings, including dimensions (equally
	or unequally spaced). Literal blanks will be recognized if the IDRS_BLANKS_ARE_LITERAL
	option is used, otherwise they are treated as nulls.
	2) Modified redic to get unequally-spaced dimension names and units from the catalog entries
	for the proper dimension variables.
-----------

Version: V2_2(C_3), Date: Tue Oct  6 09:59:10 PDT 1992
-----------
	1) Made idenc a logical function.
	2) Fixed up SGI version: time/date functions, C interface has wrappers
	for d_floor and bcopy.
	3) Added the initial version of putdic;
	NB!!! This version only modifies naming strings, and is not safe for
	modifying names of dimension variables. It is suitable for supporting
	the SET NAME functionality in drsed, provided that dimension variable
	names are not modified.
-----------

Version: V2_1(C_2), Date: Tue Jun  2 16:11:04 PDT 1992
-----------
	1) Changed the naming scheme from 'similarity' to 'equality'
	of naming strings, where two strings are considered as equal if they agree,
	irrespective of case and blanks. As before, a blank string is treated as a wild card.
	2) Inqdict no longer returns IDRS_INEXACTMATCH.
	3) Reimplemented wrdat and redat, replacing implied do loops with reads
	of pointer variables.
	4) Moved drs error strings out of drsdef.h and drscdf.h, made them local
	to drsrep.
	5) Error messages are now sent to unit 0 (stderr). Error messages in
	getslab are sent to stderr.
	6) Fixed bug in getslab, where malloced buffer space is not released if an
	error occured.
